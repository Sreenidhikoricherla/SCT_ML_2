# SCT_ML_2Mall Customer Segmentation using K-Means

📌 Project Overview

This project applies the K-Means clustering algorithm to the Mall Customer Dataset to group customers of a retail store based on their demographic and purchase history. The goal is to identify customer segments to help businesses personalize marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.

📂 Dataset

The dataset used is the Mall Customer Dataset, which contains:

CustomerID: Unique ID assigned to each customer

Gender: Male / Female

Age: Customer’s age

Annual Income (k$): Annual income in thousands of dollars

Spending Score (1-100): Score assigned based on spending patterns and behavior



---

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Python 3.x

Pandas – Data manipulation

NumPy – Numerical computations

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

Scikit-learn – Machine Learning (K-Means algorithm)



---

🚀 Steps Involved

1. Data Preprocessing

Load dataset

Handle missing values (if any)

Select features (Annual Income, Spending Score, etc.)



2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution of age, income, and spending score

Correlation analysis



3. Applying K-Means Clustering

Use the Elbow Method to find optimal number of clusters

Fit K-Means algorithm

Assign cluster labels to customers



4. Visualization

Plot clusters to interpret customer groups

Visualize spending behavior vs income





---

📊 Results

The model identifies different customer segments, such as:

High Income, High Spending

Low Income, High Spending

High Income, Low Spending

Average Spenders

Thrifty Customers


These insights help businesses target each group with suitable marketing strategies.
